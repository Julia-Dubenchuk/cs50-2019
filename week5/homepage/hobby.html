            <p>I enjoy reading books during my free time."The last book I read was "Black Swan" by Nassim Taleb.
            I am currently reading his second book, Antifragile.
            These books describe a lot of philosophical topics.
            The most significant point I made for myself is that rare events have the most significant impact
            on our lives.</p>
            <p>My favorite movie is Harry Potter, especially the third part, Prisoner of Azkaban.
            I have loved this movie since my childhood and I watch it every year.</p>
            <p>I like pizza with cheese, but lately, I've been trying to eat healthy and prefer salads
            with avocado and other vegetables.</p>
            <p>I also do sports. I used to visit the gym 5 times a week and have stretching classes.
            Now that I have moved to my parents' village, I no longer have the same opportunities as before.
            That's why I exercise at home and try to maintain a regular training routine.</p>
